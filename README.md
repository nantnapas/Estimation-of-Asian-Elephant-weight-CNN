# Estimation of Asian Elephant weight from image using Convolutional Neural Network

## Abstract

The objectives of this study are to develop Convolutional Neural Network model for Elephant’s Weight Estimation from image using transfer learning approach and compare the performance of each model. The dataset consists of 240 images of 28 elephants: 15 male and 13 female. The independent variables are elephant’s surface area (Square Meter) and their height (Centimeter). In this study, we compare the performance of VGGNet-16 Convolutional Neural Network (VGGNet-16) and ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-50). Moreover, we compare the performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is used to evaluate the performance of models. The results show that ResNet-50 model provides better performance than VGGNet-16 model with the MAE of 228.1119 kilograms. Moreover, the result shows that MLR provides more accuracy than CNN model with the MAE of 228.1119 kilograms.
